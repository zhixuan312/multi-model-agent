### `reviewPolicy` — review lifecycle per task

All task types default to `"reviewed"` (two-phase pipeline: implementer + refiner).
Only `orchestrate` forces `"none"`. Callers can override per-request.

For read-only routes (audit, review, debug, investigate, research, journal_recall),
the refiner verifies the implementer's output against source material — checking
citations, evidence accuracy, and completeness. For write routes (delegate,
execute_plan, journal_record), the refiner also fixes issues in the worktree.

| Value | Behavior | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `"reviewed"` | Two-phase pipeline: implement + review (default) | Default for all types |
| `"none"` | Skip the review stage | Trivially mechanical edits or throwaway scripts where a second-pass reviewer adds nothing |
