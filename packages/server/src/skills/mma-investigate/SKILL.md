name: mma-investigate
description: Use when you need to answer a question about the codebase ("how does X work", "where is Y called", "what does this directory do") and reading + grepping the codebase yourself would consume main-context tokens
when_to_use: A question about THIS codebase has surfaced — from the user, from a methodology skill, or from your own next-step planning — AND mmagent is running. Delegate the read/grep/synthesis to a worker so the main context stays on judgment. Codebase only — does not perform web research or git-history queries. OR you are about to read 3+ files / run any grep in main context — that's the inline-labor-leakage anti-pattern (AP2); delegate to this skill instead.

# mma-investigate

## Overview

Answer a codebase question via a read-only mmagent worker. The worker greps and reads on its cheap budget; you read its synthesis on yours.

**Core principle:** Investigation is labor (read, grep, synthesize). Delegate it. The main agent stays on judgment — deciding what the answer means and what to do with it.

## When to Use

```dot
digraph when_to_use {
    "Question about codebase?" [shape=diamond];
    "About web / git history?" [shape=diamond];
    "Already have the file in context?" [shape=diamond];
    "mma-investigate" [shape=box];
    "Read inline (1–2 reads)" [shape=box];
    "WebSearch / git log" [shape=box];

    "Question about codebase?" -> "About web / git history?";
    "About web / git history?" -> "WebSearch / git log" [label="yes"];
    "About web / git history?" -> "Already have the file in context?" [label="no"];
    "Already have the file in context?" -> "Read inline (1–2 reads)" [label="yes"];
    "Already have the file in context?" -> "mma-investigate" [label="no"];
}
```

**Use when:**
- "How does X work in this codebase?"
- "Where is Y called from?"
- "What does this directory do?"
- The answer requires reading 3+ files or grepping
- Cross-cutting investigations (auth flow across modules, data lineage)

**Don't use when:**
- The answer is in 1–2 files you already have in context → just `Read`
- It's about web docs / external APIs → `WebSearch` / `WebFetch`
- It's about git history → `git log` / `git blame`
- You need to MODIFY code based on the finding → `mma-delegate` (research + edit)
- You want to consider multiple distinct directions, not converge on one answer → `mma-explore` (divergent ideation, codebase + web)

## Endpoint

`POST /investigate?cwd=<abs-path>`

@include _shared/auth.md

## Request body

```json
{
  "question": "How does the auth middleware handle token refresh?",
  "subtype": "default",
  "filePaths": ["/project/src/auth/"],
  "contextBlockIds": []
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `question` | string | yes | Natural-language investigation question |
| `subtype` | `'default'` | no (defaults to `'default'`) | Reserved for future criteria sets; only `default` is wired today. |
| `filePaths` | string[] | no | Anchor paths the worker starts from. Worker may grep beyond. |
| `contextBlockIds` | string[] | no | IDs from `mma-context-blocks` — enables follow-up / delta investigation |
| `tools` | `'none' \| 'readonly'` | no | Default `'readonly'`. `'no-shell'` and `'full'` are rejected — investigation is read-only |

> Worker tier for `mma-investigate` is hardcoded to `complex` and is not caller-configurable. Sending `agentType` is rejected with HTTP 400.

**Anchor narrow questions with `filePaths`:**

❌ `{ "question": "Where is parseConfig called?" }` — searches the whole repo
✅ `{ "question": "Where is parseConfig called?", "filePaths": ["src/"] }` — bounded

**Why:** the worker greps and reads under a turn and wall-clock budget. Without anchors, broad questions exhaust those budgets before they finish.

## Full example

```bash
BATCH=$(curl -f --show-error -s -X POST \
  -H "X-MMA-Client: $MMA_CLIENT" \
  -H "X-MMA-Main-Model: $MMA_MAIN_MODEL" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question":"How does the auth middleware handle token refresh?"}' \
  "http://localhost:$PORT/investigate?cwd=/project")
BATCH_ID=$(echo "$BATCH" | jq -r '.batchId')
```

## Per-task report shape

Each task carries an `investigation` field on its per-task report:

```json
{
  "investigation": {
    "citations": [
      { "file": "src/auth/refresh.ts", "lines": "45-72", "claim": "Refresh handler reads bearer." }
    ],
    "confidence": { "level": "high", "rationale": "All claims directly cited." },
    "diagnostics": {
      "malformedCitationLines": 0,
      "missingRequiredSections": [],
      "invalidRequiredSections": []
    }
  }
}
```

The authoritative success signals are `completed`, `message`, and `findings`. See "v5 wire shape" above for the full envelope.

## v5 wire shape (read route)

Every task result is a `ComposePayload` — seven main-agent fields plus a telemetry block.
The main-agent fields are authoritative; the telemetry block is diagnostics.

```json
{
  "completed": true,
  "message": "Investigation complete; 3 files analysed.",
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "F1",
      "severity": "high",
      "category": "correctness",
      "claim": "The refresh handler reads bearer from Authorization header unconditionally.",
      "evidence": "src/auth/refresh.ts:45-72 — verbatim substring from worker output.",
      "suggestion": "Add a guard to handle missing Authorization header gracefully.",
      "source": "implementer"
    }
  ],
  "summary": "...",
  "filesChanged": [],
  "commitSha": null,
  "blockId": null,
  "telemetry": {
    "totalDurationMs": 1234,
    "totalCostUSD": 0.08,
    "workerSelfAssessment": "done",
    "reviewVerdict": null,
    "commitOutcome": "not_applicable",
    "stopReason": "normal",
    "haltedStage": null,
    "stages": [...]
  }
}
```

### Key fields

| Field | When populated | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `completed` | always | `true` when at least one criterion succeeded; `false` on annotator transport failure OR unmet annotate preconditions (e.g. non-`done` worker self-assessment on a read route) |
| `message` | always | human-readable summary; names blocking gates or finding IDs on failure |
| `findings` | always | `source: 'implementer'` for investigate; findings are the deliverable on read routes |
| `workerSelfAssessment` | always | `'done'` or `'failed'` — never `done_with_concerns` |
| `blockId` | always `null` | investigate is a task route, not register-context-block |

### No second review

The LLM-judge stage (`annotate`) runs once, after the worker's output. Its preconditions for read-route `completed: true`:

```
gates.implement.outcome === 'advance'
&& gates.implement.payload.workerSelfAssessment === 'done'
&& (criteriaSucceeded.length > 0 || criteriaErrors.length === 0)
```

Findings are the deliverable — a task that surfaces 5 issues is `completed: true`. Finding nothing wrong is also a valid completion.

### `completed: false` — what it means

Only on annotator transport failure. The `message` names the blocking gate. Re-dispatch with tighter `filePaths` if the worker's citations were unusable.

## Best practices

This skill is one step in the larger flow described in `multi-model-agent` → "Best practices". Recipes that involve `mma-investigate`:

- **Recipe C — Investigate-plan-execute.** `mma-investigate` → write the plan → `mma-execute-plan` → `mma-retry`. The investigation produces the synthesis you need to write the plan; the plan becomes a context block for execute-plan.

Anti-pattern alert: **`inline-labor-leakage`** (AP2). If you find yourself reading 3+ files or running any grep in main context, that's the trigger to delegate here instead. Main-context tokens cost ~10× more than worker tokens, and you only need the synthesis, not the raw reads.

## Common pitfalls

❌ **Asking for a fix instead of an answer**
> question: "Refactor the auth middleware to use JWT"

The investigator can't write — `tools: 'readonly'`. **Fix:** use `mma-delegate` for research-then-edit, or split: investigate first, then dispatch the edit.

❌ **Inline-reading instead of delegating**
About to `Read` 3+ files just to answer one question? That's the wrong tradeoff — the worker reads on its cheap budget; you read its synthesis on yours.

## Terminal context block

Every completed task automatically registers a terminal markdown context block containing the full task report (headline, investigation synthesis, citations, and annotated findings). The `blockId` is returned in each task result under the shared `blockId` field (not a separate `terminalBlockId` field). This block is immutable, lives for the session duration, and counts against the project's `maxEntries` quota (default 500).

**Use cases:**
- Pass investigation results to a downstream planning step
- Feed codebase findings into `mma-execute-plan` as shared context
- Carry investigation context forward through the investigate → plan → execute chain

The block is registered server-side at task completion; no caller action is needed to create it. Delete it explicitly via `DELETE /context-blocks/:id` when no longer needed, or let it expire on session teardown.
