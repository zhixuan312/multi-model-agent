description: Use when a frontend workflow needs a high-quality LLM brain for orchestration — send a structured prompt, get a structured response, reuse the session across workflow phases
when_to_use: A multi-phase workflow (explore → spec → plan → execute) needs an intelligent orchestrator that maintains session context across phases. Each call sends a self-contained prompt; the agent processes it and returns structured output the calling system parses directly.

# mma:orchestrate

## Overview

The orchestrate endpoint provides a session-persistent, high-quality LLM agent for multi-phase workflow orchestration. Unlike worker routes (audit, delegate, review), the orchestrate agent has no reviewer, no commit, and no findings structure — it takes a prompt and returns the output the caller needs.

**Core principle:** The frontend owns the workflow state; MMA provides the LLM continuity. Each prompt is self-contained; session reuse provides project context across phases.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- A multi-step workflow needs an intelligent brain across phases
- The calling system constructs structured prompts and expects structured responses
- Session continuity across workflow phases improves output quality
- The task requires synthesis, analysis, or decision-making — not file writing

**Don't use when:**
- You need file modifications → use `mma:delegate`
- You need structured code review → use `mma:review`
- You need document auditing → use `mma:audit`
- A single API call suffices — orchestrate is for when you need tool use + reasoning

## Endpoint

`POST /task?cwd=<abs-path>`

```json
{
  "type": "orchestrate",
  "prompt": "Synthesize the exploration results into a requirements specification...",
  "outputFormat": "json"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `"orchestrate"` | yes | Discriminator |
| `prompt` | string | yes | The full instruction for this workflow phase |
| `outputFormat` | string | no | Hint for desired output format (e.g. `"json"`, `"markdown"`) |
| `sessionIds` | object | no | `{ implementer: "<session-id>" }` — reuse a prior session |
| `contextBlockIds` | string[] | no | IDs from `mma:context-blocks` (max 2) |

> Worker tier defaults to `main` (falls back to `complex` if `agents.main` is not configured). Send `agentTier` to override if needed. Review is always skipped — there is no reviewer phase.

## Session Reuse

To maintain context across workflow phases, capture the session ID from the first response and pass it back:

```bash
# Phase 1: Exploration
RESULT=$(curl ... -d '{"type":"orchestrate","prompt":"Explore the codebase for auth patterns..."}' ...)
SESSION_ID=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.sessions.implementer.sessionId')

# Phase 2: Specification (reuse session)
RESULT=$(curl ... -d '{"type":"orchestrate","prompt":"Based on your exploration, write a spec...","sessionIds":{"implementer":"'"$SESSION_ID"'"}}' ...)
```

## Prefer the MCP tools when they are available

**Before using the HTTP/curl route below, check whether the `mma_run` MCP tool is available in
this session. If it is, USE IT INSTEAD.** The curl route documented here is the fallback for
sessions with no MCP connection.

```
mma_run({ cwd: "<abs-path>", mode: "handle", request: { type: "<task type>", ... } })
```

The request body is identical — the same `type`, `prompt`, `target`, and options described
below ride inside `request`. Poll with `mma_task_get`, block with `mma_task_wait`, stop with
`mma_task_cancel`, instead of the curl polling loop.

Why this matters, so the choice is not arbitrary:

- **Hosts that support MCP Apps render a live execution monitor** for `mma_run` — phase and
  elapsed time update in place, with a working Cancel button, and none of it costs an extra
  model turn. The curl route cannot produce that: the host has no idea a task is running, so
  progress can only be surfaced by the agent polling and re-reporting, which costs a turn each
  time. Going through curl on such a host silently gives up the better experience.
- **No token handling.** The MCP route is already authenticated; the curl route needs
  `mma print-token` and a bearer header, which is one more place a credential can leak into a
  transcript or a shell history.
- **Errors arrive structured** rather than as an HTTP body to parse.

Use the curl route when `mma_run` is genuinely absent — a bare terminal, a CI job, or a client
with no MCP support. Do not use it merely because this document spells the HTTP call out in
more detail.


## Authentication & identity headers

Every request to the multi-model-agent server requires:

| Header | Required for | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | All routes (except `/health`) | Auth — token from `mma print-token` |
| `X-MMA-Client: <client>` | All tool routes | Identifies your client. One of `claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex-cli`, `gemini-cli`. **Server returns `400 client_required` if missing.** |
| `X-MMA-Main-Model: <model-id>` | All tool routes | Calling agent's model id (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`, `gpt-5.4`). Used as `mainModel` in wire telemetry so cost-delta-vs-main and family attribution can be computed. **Server returns `400 main_model_required` if missing.** Auto-detection is intentionally not attempted — the calling client is the only reliable source. |

### Obtain the token

**From environment variable** (preferred):
```
MMA_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>
```

**From CLI**:
```bash
mma print-token
```

### Shell helper

```bash
TOKEN="${MMA_AUTH_TOKEN:-$(mma print-token)}"
MMA_CLIENT="${MMA_CLIENT:-claude-code}"
MMA_MAIN_MODEL="${MMA_MAIN_MODEL:-claude-opus-4-7}"

curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-MMA-Client: $MMA_CLIENT" \
  -H "X-MMA-Main-Model: $MMA_MAIN_MODEL" \
  ...
```

### Errors

- `401 unauthorized` — verify the token matches `~/.mma/auth-token`. The token persists across restarts; it only changes if the file is manually deleted.
- `400 client_required` — `X-MMA-Client` header is missing on a tool route. Set it to one of: `claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex-cli`, `gemini-cli`.
- `400 main_model_required` — `X-MMA-Main-Model` header is missing on a tool route. Set it to the calling agent's model id (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`, `gpt-5.4`).

## Polling for task completion

After a tool call returns a `taskId`, poll `GET /task/:taskId` until the task
reaches a terminal state.

### HTTP response shapes

| Status | Content-Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `202` | `application/json` | Still working — body is structured progress: `{ taskId, status, phase, elapsedMs, phaseElapsedMs, startedAt }` |
| `200` | `application/json` | Terminal — body is the uniform 6-field envelope (see `response-shape.md`) |
| `404` / `401` / other | — | Error — stop polling |

### Terminal envelope states

Every terminal envelope has the same six fields; inspect `error` to tell
which terminal state you're in:

| Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `error` is a real object | Task failed — read `error.code` + `error.message` |
| `error` is `null` | Task succeeded — read `output.summary` |

### Poll loop (POSIX sh)

```bash
DELAY=1
START=$(date +%s)
TIMEOUT_S=${MMA_POLL_TIMEOUT_S:-1800}
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp -t mma-poll.XXXXXX)
trap 'rm -f "$BODY_FILE"' EXIT

while true; do
  NOW=$(date +%s)
  if [ $((NOW - START)) -ge "$TIMEOUT_S" ]; then
    echo "mma: poll timed out after ${TIMEOUT_S}s" >&2
    exit 124
  fi

  STATUS=$(curl -f --show-error -o "$BODY_FILE" -w "%{http_code}" -s \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/task/$TASK_ID" || true)

  case "$STATUS" in
    202)
      cat "$BODY_FILE"; echo
      sleep "$DELAY"
      DELAY=$(( DELAY < 30 ? DELAY * 2 : 30 ))
      ;;
    200)
      cat "$BODY_FILE"
      exit 0
      ;;
    "")
      echo "mma: unreachable (curl failed)" >&2; exit 1 ;;
    *)
      echo "mma: HTTP $STATUS"; cat "$BODY_FILE" >&2; exit 1 ;;
  esac
done
```

Start at 1 s, double each iteration, cap at 30 s. The 1800-second client-side
timeout is a safety cap; most tasks complete in under 60 s. Discover `$PORT`
at runtime with `mma info --json | jq -r .port` (default: 7337).

### Caller-side tool-timeout note

The poll helper's internal `TIMEOUT_S` default is 1800s (30 minutes). If your
agent's shell tool (e.g. Claude Code's Bash) caps command wall-clock at
10 minutes by default, the helper will be killed at 10m regardless of
`TIMEOUT_S` — long-running delegations then appear to "fail" before terminal.

When invoking this poll loop, pick one:

- **Preferred — pass a 30-minute tool timeout explicitly** (e.g. Claude Code
  Bash accepts `timeout: 1800000`, up to 600000ms/10 min by default; pass the
  max the tool allows, or bump the tool's allowed ceiling via harness
  settings).
- **Alternative — cap the helper to match the tool's limit** by exporting
  `MMA_POLL_TIMEOUT_S=600` before running the loop. The helper will then
  exit 124 cleanly at 10 minutes and the caller can decide whether to
  re-poll or surface the timeout.

Never let the helper run longer than the caller's tool cap — the process
gets killed mid-poll, the caller sees a generic failure, and diagnostics
from the `TIMEOUT_S` exit path are lost.

Windows/PowerShell equivalent is planned for a later release.

## Response shapes

### POST /task?cwd=<abs> — dispatch response (202)

```json
{ "taskId": "<uuid>", "statusUrl": "/task/<uuid>" }
```

Use `taskId` to poll. `statusUrl` is a convenience pointer.

### GET /task/:taskId — terminal response (200)

The terminal JSON envelope has these 6 top-level fields:

```json
{
  "task": {
    "taskId": "<uuid>",
    "type": "<route>",
    "subtype": "<subtype or absent>",
    "status": "completed | done_with_concerns | failed"
  },
  "output": {
    "summary": { /* refiner JSON — shape varies by route, see below */ },
    "filesChanged": ["src/foo.ts", "src/bar.ts"],
    "contextBlockId": "<string or null>",
    "reviewerNote": null
  },
  "execution": {
    "sessions": { "implementer": "<session-id>", "reviewer": "<session-id or null>" },
    "worktree": null
  },
  "metrics": {
    "totalDurationMs": 12400,
    "totalCostUsd": 0.08,
    "implementer": { "durationMs": 8000, "costUsd": 0.05, "usage": { "inputTokens": 1200, "outputTokens": 800, "cachedReadTokens": 0, "cachedNonReadTokens": 0 } },
    "reviewer":     { "durationMs": 4000, "costUsd": 0.03, "usage": { "inputTokens": 900, "outputTokens": 400, "cachedReadTokens": 0, "cachedNonReadTokens": 0 } }
  },
  "raw": {
    "implementer": "<raw text output>",
    "reviewer": "<raw text output or null>"
  },
  "error": null
}
```

### How to read the envelope

**Step 1 — check `error`:**

| Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `error` is `null` | Task succeeded — read `output` |
| `error` is `{ "code": "...", "message": "..." }` | Task failed — read `error.code` + `error.message` |

**Step 2 — extract the result from `output.summary`:**

`output.summary` is the **parsed JSON** from the refiner (reviewer). Its internal shape varies by route — see the per-skill "Reading the output" section for the exact fields. Common patterns:

| Route family | What `output.summary` contains |
|---|---|
| Read routes (audit, review, investigate, debug, research) | `{ findings: [...], criteriaCovered: [...], ... }` — findings array is the main payload |
| Write routes (delegate, execute_plan) | `{ status: 'done'\|'failed', notes }` or `{ tasks: [...], notes }` |
| Spec / Plan | `{ specPath, sections, acceptanceCriteriaCount, notes }` or `{ planPath, taskCount, tasks, notes }` |
| Journal recall | `{ answer, criteriaCovered, findings: [{ weight, category, claim, evidence, topic, fallback, nodeId, nodePath }] }` |
| Journal record | `{ recorded: [...], failed: [...] }` |

**Step 3 — for read routes, extract findings:**

```
response.output.summary.findings   ← the findings array
response.output.summary.findings[i].weight      ← "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low"
response.output.summary.findings[i].category
response.output.summary.findings[i].claim       ← one-sentence summary
response.output.summary.findings[i].evidence    ← grounding text
response.output.summary.findings[i].suggestion  ← fix recommendation (some routes omit this)
```

**Step 4 — for write routes, read files changed:**

```
response.output.filesChanged       ← array of relative paths modified by the worker
response.output.contextBlockId     ← non-null for read routes (reusable in contextBlockIds)
```

**Step 5 — check `output.reviewerNote` (reviewer availability):**

`output.reviewerNote` is `null` on the normal path. When the reviewer ran but its output
couldn't be parsed, the task degrades to `status: "done_with_concerns"` with **`error: null`**
(a reviewer format flake is a concern, not a failure), and `output.summary` falls back to the
**implementer's** answer. `reviewerNote` then carries the reason:

```json
"reviewerNote": { "code": "reviewer_unavailable", "message": "<why the parse failed>" }
```

Treat a non-null `reviewerNote` as advisory: the answer in `output.summary` is the un-refined
implementer output, still usable. Never discard the task on `reviewerNote` alone.

### Common extraction mistakes

❌ **Reading `output.findings`** — this field does NOT exist. Findings are inside `output.summary.findings`.

❌ **Reading `results` or `structuredReport`** — these are legacy field names from older API versions. The current envelope uses `output.summary`.

❌ **Treating `output.summary` as a string** — it is parsed JSON (an object), not a string. If it looks like a string, the underlying output could not be parsed at all — check `output.reviewerNote` and, as a last resort, `raw.implementer`.

❌ **Ignoring `error: null` check** — a `status: "done_with_concerns"` task has `error: null` and is a success (advisory concerns only). Only `error !== null` is a failure. In particular, when a reviewer emits non-JSON, the task is `done_with_concerns` with `error: null`, `output.summary` holds the implementer answer, and `output.reviewerNote` explains the degrade — do NOT treat this as a failure.

### Error response (4xx / 5xx)

```json
{
  "error": "<code>",
  "message": "<human-readable>",
  "details": { /* optional structured context, e.g. fieldErrors for 400 */ }
}
```

`details` is optional and present only when the server has structured additional context.
