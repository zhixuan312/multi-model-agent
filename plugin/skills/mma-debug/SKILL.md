# mma-debug

## Overview

Submit a problem, context, and hypothesis to a worker for focused debugging. Unlike `mma-audit` and `mma-review`, all `target.paths` are investigated TOGETHER in a single task (not parallelized per file) — debugging needs cross-file reasoning.

**Core principle:** The hypothesis is judgment (your job). Reading files and reproducing the failure is labor (the worker's job). Pass the hypothesis as input; receive structured findings.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- A test fails / build breaks / runtime behavior is unexpected
- The root cause likely spans 2+ files
- You have a hypothesis to test (or want the worker to suggest one)
- A systematic-debugging workflow routed the investigation here

**Don't use when:**
- The error message points at one file you can read in 30 seconds → just `Read`
- You don't know what's broken yet → use `mma-investigate` first to map the area
- You already know the fix → skip debug, dispatch `mma-delegate` with the fix

## Endpoint

`POST /task?cwd=<abs-path>`

## Authentication & identity headers

Every request to the multi-model-agent server requires:

| Header | Required for | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | All routes (except `/health`) | Auth — token from `mma print-token` |
| `X-MMA-Client: <client>` | All tool routes | Identifies your client. One of `claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex-cli`, `gemini-cli`. **Server returns `400 client_required` if missing.** |
| `X-MMA-Main-Model: <model-id>` | All tool routes | Calling agent's model id (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`, `gpt-5.4`). Used as `mainModel` in wire telemetry so cost-delta-vs-main and family attribution can be computed. **Server returns `400 main_model_required` if missing.** Auto-detection is intentionally not attempted — the calling client is the only reliable source. |

### Obtain the token

**From environment variable** (preferred):
```
MMA_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>
```

**From CLI**:
```bash
mma print-token
```

### Shell helper

```bash
TOKEN="${MMA_AUTH_TOKEN:-$(mma print-token)}"
MMA_CLIENT="${MMA_CLIENT:-claude-code}"
MMA_MAIN_MODEL="${MMA_MAIN_MODEL:-claude-opus-4-7}"

curl \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "X-MMA-Client: $MMA_CLIENT" \
  -H "X-MMA-Main-Model: $MMA_MAIN_MODEL" \
  ...
```

### Errors

- `401 unauthorized` — verify the token matches `~/.mma/auth-token`. The token persists across restarts; it only changes if the file is manually deleted.
- `400 client_required` — `X-MMA-Client` header is missing on a tool route. Set it to one of: `claude-code`, `cursor`, `codex-cli`, `gemini-cli`.
- `400 main_model_required` — `X-MMA-Main-Model` header is missing on a tool route. Set it to the calling agent's model id (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7`, `gpt-5.4`).


## Request body

```json
{
  "type": "debug",
  "prompt": "POST /login returns 500 when password contains special characters",
  "target": {
    "paths": [
      "/project/src/auth/login.ts",
      "/project/src/auth/password.ts"
    ]
  },
  "contextBlockIds": []
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `prompt` | string | yes | What is broken (one sentence; concrete symptom, min 1 char) |
| `target.paths` | string[] | no | All files investigated together (cross-file reasoning) |
| `contextBlockIds` | string[] | no | IDs from `mma-context-blocks` (max 2) — e.g. error logs, traces |

> Worker tier defaults to `complex`. Send `agentTier` to override if needed.

## Full example

```bash
RESULT=$(curl -f --show-error -s -X POST \
  -H "X-MMA-Client: $MMA_CLIENT" \
  -H "X-MMA-Main-Model: $MMA_MAIN_MODEL" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"type":"debug","prompt":"Tests fail on CI only","target":{"paths":["/project/src/config.ts"]}}' \
  "http://localhost:$PORT/task?cwd=/project")
TASK_ID=$(echo "$RESULT" | jq -r '.taskId')
```

## Polling for task completion

After a tool call returns a `taskId`, poll `GET /task/:taskId` until the task
reaches a terminal state.

### HTTP response shapes

| Status | Content-Type | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `202` | `application/json` | Still working — body is structured progress: `{ taskId, status, phase, elapsedMs, phaseElapsedMs, startedAt }` |
| `200` | `application/json` | Terminal — body is the uniform 6-field envelope (see `response-shape.md`) |
| `404` / `401` / other | — | Error — stop polling |

### Terminal envelope states

Every terminal envelope has the same six fields; inspect `error` to tell
which terminal state you're in:

| Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `error` is a real object | Task failed — read `error.code` + `error.message` |
| `error` is `null` | Task succeeded — read `output.summary` |

### Poll loop (POSIX sh)

```bash
DELAY=1
START=$(date +%s)
TIMEOUT_S=${MMA_POLL_TIMEOUT_S:-1800}
BODY_FILE=$(mktemp -t mma-poll.XXXXXX)
trap 'rm -f "$BODY_FILE"' EXIT

while true; do
  NOW=$(date +%s)
  if [ $((NOW - START)) -ge "$TIMEOUT_S" ]; then
    echo "mma: poll timed out after ${TIMEOUT_S}s" >&2
    exit 124
  fi

  STATUS=$(curl -f --show-error -o "$BODY_FILE" -w "%{http_code}" -s \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
    "http://127.0.0.1:$PORT/task/$TASK_ID" || true)

  case "$STATUS" in
    202)
      cat "$BODY_FILE"; echo
      sleep "$DELAY"
      DELAY=$(( DELAY < 30 ? DELAY * 2 : 30 ))
      ;;
    200)
      cat "$BODY_FILE"
      exit 0
      ;;
    "")
      echo "mma: unreachable (curl failed)" >&2; exit 1 ;;
    *)
      echo "mma: HTTP $STATUS"; cat "$BODY_FILE" >&2; exit 1 ;;
  esac
done
```

Start at 1 s, double each iteration, cap at 30 s. The 1800-second client-side
timeout is a safety cap; most tasks complete in under 60 s. Discover `$PORT`
at runtime with `mma info --json | jq -r .port` (default: 7337).

### Caller-side tool-timeout note

The poll helper's internal `TIMEOUT_S` default is 1800s (30 minutes). If your
agent's shell tool (e.g. Claude Code's Bash) caps command wall-clock at
10 minutes by default, the helper will be killed at 10m regardless of
`TIMEOUT_S` — long-running delegations then appear to "fail" before terminal.

When invoking this poll loop, pick one:

- **Preferred — pass a 30-minute tool timeout explicitly** (e.g. Claude Code
  Bash accepts `timeout: 1800000`, up to 600000ms/10 min by default; pass the
  max the tool allows, or bump the tool's allowed ceiling via harness
  settings).
- **Alternative — cap the helper to match the tool's limit** by exporting
  `MMA_POLL_TIMEOUT_S=600` before running the loop. The helper will then
  exit 124 cleanly at 10 minutes and the caller can decide whether to
  re-poll or surface the timeout.

Never let the helper run longer than the caller's tool cap — the process
gets killed mid-poll, the caller sees a generic failure, and diagnostics
from the `TIMEOUT_S` exit path are lost.

Windows/PowerShell equivalent is planned for a later release.


## Response shapes

### POST /task?cwd=<abs> — dispatch response (202)

```json
{ "taskId": "<uuid>", "statusUrl": "/task/<uuid>" }
```

Use `taskId` to poll. `statusUrl` is a convenience pointer.

### GET /task/:taskId — terminal response (200)

The terminal JSON envelope has these 6 top-level fields:

```json
{
  "task": {
    "taskId": "<uuid>",
    "type": "<route>",
    "subtype": "<subtype or absent>",
    "status": "completed | done_with_concerns | failed"
  },
  "output": {
    "summary": { /* refiner JSON — shape varies by route, see below */ },
    "filesChanged": ["src/foo.ts", "src/bar.ts"],
    "contextBlockId": "<string or null>",
    "reviewerNote": null
  },
  "execution": {
    "sessions": { "implementer": "<session-id>", "reviewer": "<session-id or null>" },
    "worktree": null
  },
  "metrics": {
    "totalDurationMs": 12400,
    "totalCostUsd": 0.08,
    "implementer": { "durationMs": 8000, "costUsd": 0.05, "usage": { "inputTokens": 1200, "outputTokens": 800, "cachedReadTokens": 0, "cachedNonReadTokens": 0 } },
    "reviewer":     { "durationMs": 4000, "costUsd": 0.03, "usage": { "inputTokens": 900, "outputTokens": 400, "cachedReadTokens": 0, "cachedNonReadTokens": 0 } }
  },
  "raw": {
    "implementer": "<raw text output>",
    "reviewer": "<raw text output or null>"
  },
  "error": null
}
```

### How to read the envelope

**Step 1 — check `error`:**

| Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `error` is `null` | Task succeeded — read `output` |
| `error` is `{ "code": "...", "message": "..." }` | Task failed — read `error.code` + `error.message` |

**Step 2 — extract the result from `output.summary`:**

`output.summary` is the **parsed JSON** from the refiner (reviewer). Its internal shape varies by route — see the per-skill "Reading the output" section for the exact fields. Common patterns:

| Route family | What `output.summary` contains |
|---|---|
| Read routes (audit, review, investigate, debug, research) | `{ findings: [...], criteriaCovered: [...], ... }` — findings array is the main payload |
| Write routes (delegate, execute_plan) | `{ status: 'done'\|'failed', notes }` or `{ tasks: [...], notes }` |
| Spec / Plan | `{ specPath, sections, acceptanceCriteriaCount, notes }` or `{ planPath, taskCount, tasks, notes }` |
| Journal recall | `{ answer, criteriaCovered, findings: [{ weight, category, claim, evidence, topic, fallback, nodeId, nodePath }] }` |
| Journal record | `{ recorded: [...], failed: [...] }` |

**Step 3 — for read routes, extract findings:**

```
response.output.summary.findings   ← the findings array
response.output.summary.findings[i].weight      ← "critical" | "high" | "medium" | "low"
response.output.summary.findings[i].category
response.output.summary.findings[i].claim       ← one-sentence summary
response.output.summary.findings[i].evidence    ← grounding text
response.output.summary.findings[i].suggestion  ← fix recommendation (some routes omit this)
```

**Step 4 — for write routes, read files changed:**

```
response.output.filesChanged       ← array of relative paths modified by the worker
response.output.contextBlockId     ← non-null for read routes (reusable in contextBlockIds)
```

**Step 5 — check `output.reviewerNote` (reviewer availability):**

`output.reviewerNote` is `null` on the normal path. When the reviewer ran but its output
couldn't be parsed, the task degrades to `status: "done_with_concerns"` with **`error: null`**
(a reviewer format flake is a concern, not a failure), and `output.summary` falls back to the
**implementer's** answer. `reviewerNote` then carries the reason:

```json
"reviewerNote": { "code": "reviewer_unavailable", "message": "<why the parse failed>" }
```

Treat a non-null `reviewerNote` as advisory: the answer in `output.summary` is the un-refined
implementer output, still usable. Never discard the task on `reviewerNote` alone.

### Common extraction mistakes

❌ **Reading `output.findings`** — this field does NOT exist. Findings are inside `output.summary.findings`.

❌ **Reading `results` or `structuredReport`** — these are legacy field names from older API versions. The current envelope uses `output.summary`.

❌ **Treating `output.summary` as a string** — it is parsed JSON (an object), not a string. If it looks like a string, the underlying output could not be parsed at all — check `output.reviewerNote` and, as a last resort, `raw.implementer`.

❌ **Ignoring `error: null` check** — a `status: "done_with_concerns"` task has `error: null` and is a success (advisory concerns only). Only `error !== null` is a failure. In particular, when a reviewer emits non-JSON, the task is `done_with_concerns` with `error: null`, `output.summary` holds the implementer answer, and `output.reviewerNote` explains the degrade — do NOT treat this as a failure.

### Error response (4xx / 5xx)

```json
{
  "error": "<code>",
  "message": "<human-readable>",
  "details": { /* optional structured context, e.g. fieldErrors for 400 */ }
}
```

`details` is optional and present only when the server has structured additional context.


## Reading the findings

The main agent reads findings from the terminal envelope at `output.summary.findings` (NOT `output.findings` — that field does not exist). `output.summary` is the parsed refiner JSON; findings are nested inside it. Read-only routes like `mma-debug` do not produce commits — `execution.worktree` is always `null`.

### Finding shape

Every finding in `output.summary.findings` has this shape:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `weight` | `'critical' \| 'high' \| 'medium' \| 'low'` | Severity tier. |
| `category` | string | Topical bucket, e.g. `root-cause`, `reproduction`. |
| `claim` | string | One-sentence summary. |
| `evidence` | string | Verbatim from source when grounded. |
| `file` | string or null | File path where the finding was observed. |
| `line` | number or null | Line number in the file. |

`output.summary` also includes an `answer` field with the debug narrative.

## Best practices

This skill is one step in the larger flow described in `multi-model-agent` → "Best practices". Recipes that involve `mma-debug`:

- **Recipe B — Debug-fix-review.** `mma-debug` → `mma-delegate` (apply fix) → `mma-review` with the acceptance criteria in the brief. Strict order. Register the failing test output / reproduction log as a context block before the debug call; reuse it on the review call.

Anti-pattern alert: **`inline-labor-leakage`** (AP2). If you're about to read 3+ files in main context to "understand the bug," that's the labor we delegate — call `mma-debug` with the hypothesis instead.

## Common pitfalls

❌ **Vague problem in `prompt`**
> "The login is broken"

Worker has no symptom to chase. **Fix:** specific reproducer — `"POST /login with body {user:'a@b.c', pass:'café'} returns 500 with 'invalid character' in stderr"`.

❌ **No hypothesis in `prompt`**
The worker explores blindly, often investigates the wrong area first. **Fix:** even a weak hypothesis ("might be encoding-related") narrows the search space.

❌ **Splitting one bug across multiple `mma-debug` calls**
Debug intentionally bundles `target.paths` for cross-file reasoning. Splitting defeats this. **Fix:** one call with all suspect files; if you really have N independent failures, use `mma-delegate` with N tasks.

❌ **Treating `mma-debug` as the fix step**
Debug investigates and proposes; it doesn't necessarily write the fix. **Fix:** if the worker identifies a fix, dispatch `mma-delegate` to implement it (or write it inline if you understand it).

❌ **Skipping when an error message looks self-explanatory**
Often the obvious cause isn't the real one. **Fix:** a 30-second debug pass costs less than a wrong fix that breaks something else.

## Terminal context block

Every completed **read-route** task (audit / review / debug / investigate / research) auto-registers a reusable terminal context block containing its report (headline + findings). The block id is returned on the result as **`contextBlockId`**. Write routes (delegate / execute-plan) return `contextBlockId: null` — their record is the commit, not a block. This block is immutable, lives for the session duration, and counts against the project's `maxEntries` quota (default 500).

Use it for delta follow-ups — feed prior results' block ids into a later call's `contextBlockIds`, filtering out nulls:

    contextBlockIds: priorResults.map(r => r.contextBlockId).filter((id) => id !== null)

**Use cases:**
- Pass debug findings to a downstream `mma-delegate` fix step
- Feed the root-cause analysis into a follow-up `mma-review` with acceptance criteria in the brief
- Carry debug context forward through the debug → fix → review chain

The block is registered server-side at task completion; no caller action is needed to create it. Delete it explicitly via `DELETE /context-blocks/:id` when no longer needed, or let it expire on session teardown.

## Outcome semantics

**Success vs failure:** Check `error` in the terminal envelope. `error === null` means the task succeeded — read `output.summary`. `error !== null` (with `code` + `message`) means it failed.

**Empty findings is not a failure.** A debug session with zero findings is a success — it means "I looked hard and found nothing." Check `output.summary.findings.length === 0`.

## Error handling

### HTTP status decision table

| Status | Code | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `400` | `invalid_request` | Fix the request body or query params |
| `401` | `unauthorized` | Verify token matches `~/.mma/auth-token` |
| `403` | `forbidden` | `cwd` query param missing or out of scope |
| `404` | `not_found` | Wrong `taskId` or resource does not exist |
| `409` | `invalid_task_state` / `pinned` | Task in wrong state; check current state first |
| `413` | `payload_too_large` | Reduce content size (context block or body) |
| `429` | `rate_limited` | Wait `Retry-After` seconds, then retry |
| `503` | `project_cap_exceeded` | Too many concurrent projects; wait and retry |
| `5xx` | server error | Retry once after 2 s; escalate if it persists |

### Network failures

Retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1 s → 2 s → 4 s).
If the server is unreachable, check that `mma serve` is running:
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:$PORT/health   # expects { "status": "ok" }  (v4.0 — see spec C13)
```

### Auth errors (401)

```bash
export MMA_AUTH_TOKEN=$(mma print-token)
```

The token persists across restarts at `~/.mma/auth-token`. It only changes if the file is manually deleted.
